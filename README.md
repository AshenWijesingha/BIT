# BIT Repository - PDF Viewer

A modern, responsive web-based PDF viewer for Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) course materials.

**Version:** 3.1.0

## Features

- 📚 **Auto-updating File Organization**: Automatically detects and displays new folders and PDFs added to the repository
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all devices with proper touch targets and responsive design
- 🌙 **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- 🔍 **Search**: Quickly find PDFs by name with search in both hero section and sidebar
- ⭐ **Favorites**: Mark frequently accessed PDFs
- 📖 **Smart PDF Rendering**: Uses native PDF viewer on desktop, PDF.js canvas rendering on mobile
- 📦 **Self-hosted PDF engine**: PDF.js and JSZip are vendored in `vendor/` — no external CDN is required to view PDFs, so rendering works reliably (and offline) without third-party/CSP issues
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**: Clean interface following best practices for accessibility and usability
- 📲 **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install as a native app on mobile and desktop
- 🔒 **Enterprise Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS prevention, secure DOM manipulation
- ⚡ **Offline Support**: Service Worker provides caching and offline access to viewed PDFs
- 📊 **Statistics Dashboard**: View file count, subjects, and favorites statistics on the homepage
- ℹ️ **About & Contact**: Dedicated modals for information, terms of use, and contact/feedback options
- 🔗 **Quick Access Links**: Fast navigation to subjects directly from the homepage
- 📋 **Share Functionality**: Copy PDF links to clipboard for easy sharing

## Auto-Update Feature

The website automatically updates when new PDF files or folders are added to the repository:

### How It Works

1. **File Structure Generation**: The `generate-file-list.js` script scans the repository for PDF files and generates a `files.json` file
2. **GitHub Action**: A workflow (`.github/workflows/update-file-list.yml`) automatically runs when:
   - New PDF files are added
   - Changes are pushed to `BIT Project/` or `Semester 5/` folders
   - Manually triggered via workflow dispatch
3. **Dynamic Loading**: The webpage loads the file structure from `files.json` at runtime

### Manual Update

To manually update the file list:

```bash
node generate-file-list.js
```

This will regenerate `files.json` with the current repository structure.

### Local Testing

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `node generate-file-list.js` to generate the file list
3. Serve the files using any local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js http-server
